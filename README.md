# Paint
A paint program for Software Development (03-60-280) created by Joshua Presley and Joseph Dao

#Objective
to create a program with similar features as Microsoft Paint, including, but not limited to, drawing with the mouse, uploading an image to draw with, an inclusion of menus and menu items, as well as various toolbars to make the experience user friendly.

#Language
this program will be written fully in Java. We may choose to implement the user interface with swing packages or include the use of JavaFx.

#Latest update
V0.05 - a very early working version. Still in the process of creating more brushes/tools. 
 * lines look better, added a menubar, and can change color
